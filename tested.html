                God gives us both a gift and a test. A new season does not only bring new opportunities
                it also reveals our integrity, our honesty, and our commitment to walk in God’s will.
                As we step into this new season the Lord has given us, the question is not only where God is leading us,
                but how we will walk with Him.<br>

                The Bible reminds us that walking in God’s will requires more than words it requires a life anchored in
                integrity and strengthened by commitment.

                <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">THE PRESSURE OF A NEW SEASON</p>
                Every new season tests our integrity.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Pain of the Season</p>

                Job experienced deep loss his family, his livelihood, and his health were taken from him. New seasons
                often come after loss, change, or shaking. God allows pressure not to destroy us, but to reveal what is
                within us.<br>
                <br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Persuasion in the Season</p>

                Job’s wife urged him to abandon his integrity:
                “Curse God, and die.” In seasons of pressure, voices will rise
                that encourage compromise, bitterness, or withdrawal from God.
                <br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">The Position of Faith in the Season</p>
                Job stood firm. He remembered God’s goodness and declared, “Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips. Integrity is choosing faithfulness even when circumstances are unfavorable.<br><br>

                
                
                <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Respecting God’s Commandments</p>
                Christmas reminds us that God is faithful and those who follow Him must live faithfully in return.
                Remembering
                God’s goodness should lead us to respect His Word.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Devotion: Fulfilling Our Vows</p>

                Devotion is more than emotion; it is love expressed through obedience. When we truly love God, keeping
                His
                commandments becomes a joy, not a burden (John 14:15). Scripture warns us not to make promises lightly,
                but to
                fulfill what we vow to God (Ecclesiastes 5:4–5).

                Christ kept every promise He made His coming, His sacrifice, His resurrection, and His future return.
                Because He
                fulfilled His promises, we must honor ours.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Direction: Walking in His Ways</p>

                Once God has our heart, He desires to guide our steps. Obedience is not restriction it is protection.
                God’s Word
                lights our path, and Christ Himself is the way, the truth, and the life. Real faith is visible, lived
                out daily
                through obedience.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">Distribution: Honoring God with What He Entrusted</p>

                Giving is not merely a suggestion it is a command rooted in stewardship. God does not ask for our
                resources
                because He lacks, but because we need to trust Him. Distribution flows naturally from devotion and
                direction.
                When God owns our heart, He also directs our hands.<br><br>

                <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Responding with Generous Commitment</p>
                Because Christ gave Himself fully, we are called to give joyfully.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Heart Entirely</p>

                The heart is the control center of life. What holds our heart controls our actions. God does not want
                our money
                without our heart, nor our heart without obedience. Wholehearted devotion produces joy, while
                half-hearted
                obedience leads to frustration.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Hands Willingly</p>

                God works through willing hands. He invites, not forces, His people to serve. From the shepherds to the
                wise
                men, Christmas faith always moves people to action. Service is the visible expression of a surrendered
                heart.<br><br>

                <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Harvest Gratefully</p>

                True thanksgiving is expressed through firstfruits offering God the best, not the leftovers. The Old
                Testament
                emphasized giving the choicest portion, motivated by gratitude rather than obligation. Firstfruits
                represent
                appreciation for God’s mercy, grace, and provision.<br><br>

                <p class="close" style="font-weight: bolder;">Conclusion:</p> The Greatest Christmas Response

                Christ did His part now give Him your heart.<br>
                He left His throne<br>
                - will you give Him your time?
                He gave His life<br>
                - will you give Him your loyalty?
                He offered salvation<br>
                - will you offer surrender?
                He gave everything<br>
                - will you give Him your heart?<br><br>

                <p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Christ has done His part.
                    Now it is our turn give Him your heart.</p>
