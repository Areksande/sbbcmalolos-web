        Ang Pasko ay panahon ng pagbibigayan. Ang mga regalo ay binabalot, ang mga sorpresa ay inihahanda,
        nagsasama-sama ang mga pamilya, at pinapainit ang mga puso.
        Ang nais ng Diyos ay ang iyong puso hindi bahagi lamang nito, hindi kalahati, kundi ang iyong buong puso.Ito ang
        dahilan kung bakit Siya dumating. Ito ang dahilan kung bakit isinilang si Cristo. Ang sabsaban sa Bethlehem ay
        tumuturo sa krus ng Kalbaryo, sapagkat ginampanan na ni Cristo ang Kanyang bahagi, kaya ibigay mo sa Kanya ang
        iyong puso.
        Sapagkat ang Pasko ay hindi tungkol sa pagtanggap ng mga materyal na regalo, kundi tungkol sa pagbabalik ng
        espirituwal na pasasalamat. Ang Dakilang Tagapagbigay ng lahat ng bagay ay tumatawag sa atin na ibigay ang
        pinakadakilang regalo pabalik sa Kanya ang ating mga sarili. <br><br>

        <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Remembering the Goodness of Christ</p>

        The story of Christmas is the story of God’s goodness, grace, and generosity. Gratitude begins with remembrance.
        A thankful heart looks back at what Christ has already done.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">His Coming Reveals His Goodness</p>

        For hundreds of years, God reminded His people that a Savior was coming. Through prophets like Isaiah and Micah,
        God revealed details of Christ’s birth, purpose, and identity. Despite Israel’s repeated failures sin,
        rebellion, idolatry, and captivity God remained faithful. His promises never changed because God Himself does
        not change (Malachi 3:6).<br>

        When the fullness of time came, God sent His Son (Galatians 4:4). Jesus was born under the law to fulfill it
        perfectly for us. Christmas reveals that if God can fulfill His greatest promise the gift of salvation He can
        surely fulfill every promise in our lives.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">His Cross Reveals His Grace</p>

        The cradle would be meaningless without the cross. Jesus did not come merely to live among us, but to die for
        us. Through His sacrifice, we see grace in its fullest form. He gave His life, His blood, and His body so that
        we could receive forgiveness and eternal life.<br>

        Every blessing we enjoy today exists because Christ paid the price. His sustaining grace preserves us daily, and
        His saving love continues to redeem and restore us. A grateful heart remembers the cross and responds with
        surrender.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">His Care Reveals His Generosity</p>
        God’s generosity is complete and unmatched. He did not give an angel or a message He gave His Son. While Israel
        expected a political king, God sent a spiritual Savior. What humanity wanted could not save them, but what they
        needed came wrapped in swaddling clothes.
        Christmas proves that God’s care is extravagant. If God has given us His very best, why would we withhold our
        obedience, our commitment, or our hearts from Him?<br><br>

        <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Respecting God’s Commandments</p>
        Christmas reminds us that God is faithful and those who follow Him must live faithfully in return. Remembering
        God’s goodness should lead us to respect His Word.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Devotion: Fulfilling Our Vows</p>

        Devotion is more than emotion; it is love expressed through obedience. When we truly love God, keeping His
        commandments becomes a joy, not a burden (John 14:15). Scripture warns us not to make promises lightly, but to
        fulfill what we vow to God (Ecclesiastes 5:4–5).

        Christ kept every promise He made His coming, His sacrifice, His resurrection, and His future return. Because He
        fulfilled His promises, we must honor ours.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Direction: Walking in His Ways</p>

        Once God has our heart, He desires to guide our steps. Obedience is not restriction it is protection. God’s Word
        lights our path, and Christ Himself is the way, the truth, and the life. Real faith is visible, lived out daily
        through obedience.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold; ">Distribution: Honoring God with What He Entrusted</p>

        Giving is not merely a suggestion it is a command rooted in stewardship. God does not ask for our resources
        because He lacks, but because we need to trust Him. Distribution flows naturally from devotion and direction.
        When God owns our heart, He also directs our hands.<br><br>

      <p class="main" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Responding with Generous Commitment</p>
        Because Christ gave Himself fully, we are called to give joyfully.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Heart Entirely</p>

        The heart is the control center of life. What holds our heart controls our actions. God does not want our money
        without our heart, nor our heart without obedience. Wholehearted devotion produces joy, while half-hearted
        obedience leads to frustration.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Hands Willingly</p>

        God works through willing hands. He invites, not forces, His people to serve. From the shepherds to the wise
        men, Christmas faith always moves people to action. Service is the visible expression of a surrendered heart.<br><br>

        <p class="txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Give God Your Harvest Gratefully</p>

        True thanksgiving is expressed through firstfruits offering God the best, not the leftovers. The Old Testament
        emphasized giving the choicest portion, motivated by gratitude rather than obligation. Firstfruits represent
        appreciation for God’s mercy, grace, and provision.<br><br>

        <p class="close" style="font-weight: bolder;">Conclusion:</p> The Greatest Christmas Response

        Christ did His part now give Him your heart.<br>
        He left His throne<br>
        - will you give Him your time?
        He gave His life<br>
        - will you give Him your loyalty?
        He offered salvation<br>
        - will you offer surrender?
        He gave everything<br>
        - will you give Him your heart?<br><br>

        <p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Christ has done His part.
        Now it is our turn  give Him your heart.</p>
